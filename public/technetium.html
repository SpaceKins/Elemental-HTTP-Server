<h1>Technetium</h1>
<h2>Tc</h2>
<h3>Atomic number 43</h3>
<p>Technetium (/tɛkˈniːʃiəm/) is a chemical element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. All of its isotopes are radioactive, making it the lightest element that has no stable isotopes, and one of only two such elements followed by elements with stable isotopes (the other being promethium). Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts are found in nature. Naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.</p>
